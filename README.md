## Description of dataset 
Data Source:
The flexible pressure imaging system used in this study was independently developed by our research group, based on a flexible piezoresistive film array and a custom-designed parallel acquisition circuit. Clinical data were collected from Xinhua Hospital (Shanghai, China) and two other collaborating medical institutions.

Data Content:
The dataset consists of buttock pressure distribution measurements from both healthy controls and patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Data were acquired under controlled sitting conditions using the self-developed system. The health status and LDH disease status of each subject are recorded separately in an xlsx spreadsheet file.


Data Representation: In the dataset, Each subject's buttock pressure map is stored as a single grayscale image file in JPEG format.
